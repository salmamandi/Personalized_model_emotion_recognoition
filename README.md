# Personalized_model_emotion_recognoition
Data folder: It contains file for each user. Each file has 89 features.
model_userwise: It is the code file. This code runs for one user at a time.I haven't used any loop, so that I can observe each user separately.
I provide indices to select 13 features among 89 features within this code.
